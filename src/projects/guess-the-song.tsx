      One of the best road trip games is shuffling a playlist and guessing the
      song.
    </span>,
    <span key={1}>
      But then lockdown came... like 3 times aha. So no roadtrips for me ðŸ¤¡
    </span>,
    <span key={2}>
      I made a Discord bot that hosts song guessing competitions so that we
      could keep playing at home. It takes any Spotify playlist and has its
      own score leaderboard!
    </span>,

      I submitted it as my individual entry for the CSESoc Personal Project
      Competition 2021, which won First place and the People{'\''}s Choice vote!
