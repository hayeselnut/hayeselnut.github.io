      The <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Mini Crossword</a> by
      the New York Times is a fun daily puzzle my friends play everyday.

      There{'\''}s an inbuilt statistics page but you can only see yourself.
    </span>,
    <span key={2}>
      Oh, and it{'\''}s also a premium feature ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘.
    </span>,
    <span key={3}>
      I wanted to track my friend{'\''}s progress over time so I made a
      dashboard by scraping the daily leaderboard and storing everyone{'\''}s
      results and time.
    </span>,
    <span key={4}>
      I only managed to finish the frontend though since the NYT{'\''}s bot detection
      was too stronk ðŸ˜¢
